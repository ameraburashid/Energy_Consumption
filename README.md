# Energy_Consumption

# Basis of the project
the canadian government has introduced new policy for carbon taxation in the year 2019. this project checks weather the legistlations that has been introduced has a significant impact on reducing the polluting energy sources vs the increase of renewable sources of energy. 

# hypothesis
H0: Carbon Tax introduced in 2019 does not have a significant impact on reducing polluting energy sources compared to the increase of renewable sources of energy

HA: Carbon Tax introduced in 2019 has a significant impact on reducing polluting energy sources compared to the increase of renewable sources of energy 

# notebooks descriptions 
The dataframe_creation notebook:
    this notebook consist of definitions for retrieving the data from the CSV files then create a dataframe to work in python 

GenChart notebook:
    this notebook contain the entire process for (Gen Chart_Data.csv) data wrangling and analysis. 

# Results 
the test statistics showed a p-Value < 0.05 for both renewable and non-renewable energy sources. 
the visual graphs shows an increase in renewable energy and a decrease in most of the non-renewable energy
this suggests that the policy has a significant impact on the type of energy generation and the H0 is rejected
